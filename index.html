          My recent development has been focused on CS and Web Design on a contract basis, with goals to bring these skills into the classroom as well.
          With regards to this I have experience with <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> as well as some experience with <strong>Node.js, MongoDB</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.
          <br />
          On a personal note, I love hot coffee ‚òï, keeping and catching fish üêü, and practicing martial arts ü•ä.
